# Reentrant Lock in Java

The traditional way to achieve thread synchronization in Java is by the use of synchronized keyword. While it provides a certain basic synchronization, the synchronized keyword is quite rigid in its use. For example, a thread can take a lock only once. Synchronized blocks donâ€™t offer any mechanism of a waiting queue and after the exit of one thread, any thread can take the lock. This could lead to starvation of resources for some other thread for a very long period of time.

Reentrant Locks are provided in Java to provide synchronization with greater flexibility.

## What are Reentrant Locks?

The ReentrantLock class implements the Lock interface and provides synchronization to methods while accessing shared resources. The code which manipulates the shared resource is surrounded by calls to lock and unlock method. This gives a lock to the current working thread and blocks all other threads which are trying to take a lock on the shared resource.

As the name says, ReentrantLock allow threads to enter into lock on a resource more than once. When the thread first enters into lock, a hold count is set to one. Before unlocking the thread can re-enter into lock again and every time hold count is incremented by one. For every unlock request, hold count is decremented by one and when hold count is 0, the resource is unlocked.

Reentrant Locks also offer a fairness parameter, by which the lock would abide by the order of the lock request i.e. after a thread unlocks the resource, the lock would go to the thread which has been waiting for the longest time. This fairness mode is set up by passing true to the constructor of the lock.

These locks are used in the following way:

```java 
public void some_method() { 
        reentrantlock.lock(); 
        try
        { 
            //Do some work 
        } 
        catch(Exception e) 
        { 
            e.printStackTrace(); 
        } 
        finally
        { 
            reentrantlock.unlock(); 
        } 
          
} 
```
